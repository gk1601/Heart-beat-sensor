# Heart-beat-sensor
Heart rate is a very vital health parameter that is directly related to the soundness of the human cardiovascular system. This project describes a technique of measuring the heart rate through a fingertip using a PIC microcontroller. While the heart is beating, it is actually pumping blood throughout the body, and that makes the blood volume inside the finger artery to change too. The reflected signal is detected by photodiode sensor. This fluctuation of blood can be detected through an optical sensing mechanism placed around the fingertip. The signal can be amplified further for the microcontroller to count the rate of fluctuation, which is actually the heart rate.   Therefore, a two stage high gain, active low pass filter is designed using two operational amplifiers to filter and amplify the signal to appropriate voltage level so that pulses can counted by microcontroller. The heart rate is than displayed on a 3 digit seven segment display. The microcontroller used in this project is PIC16F628A
